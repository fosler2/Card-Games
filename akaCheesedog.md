# **AKA Cheesedog**

#### _For 3ish to 10ish players_

<br/>

## _The Deal_

0. Shuffle two decks together (ideally with different backs, for separating back out when you're done playing)
1. Deal out four cards, face down, to each player.
2. Deal out four cards, face up, to each player.
3. Deal out the remaining cards (yes, all of them), face down, to each player.

## _Individual Setup_

1. Arrange your face-down and face-up cards however you prefer, but a good starting layout is:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**XXXX**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**YYYY**

&emsp;&emsp;where the X's are the face-down cards and the Y's are the face-ups.

2. Pick up your remaining pile. This is your starting hand.

## _Gameplay_

0. The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards.
1. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by playing a card (or cards) in the middle of the table.
2. Cards may be played according to the following rules:

> - MAIN RULE: Played card(s) must be GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO the card value at the top of the current pile.
> - MAIN RULE 2: If you have no cards to play, you have to pick up the pile.
> - ACES are HIGH.
> - If you have multiple of the same card, you may play them all at the same time.
> - If there are FOUR or more of the same card on the top of the pile, the pile is CLEARED to DISCARD.
> - If you CLEAR the pile, you get to start the new pile by playing any card(s).
>   > Special Cards:
>   > &emsp;&emsp; _Note: special cards (except 2) must still follow the main rule_
>   >
>   > - 7: SKIP the next player. Multiple 7's skip multiple players.
>   > - 8: the NEXT player has to play a card LESS THAN or EQUAL TO 8
>   > - 9: REVERSE the direction of play. Multiple 9's reverse the direction multiple times.
>   > - 10: CLEAR the pile to discard
>   > - 2: Playable at any time regardless of what's on the pile. Think of this card as a lifeline.

3. Once you have played all of the cards in your hand, pick up your FACE-UP cards. These are now your hand, and you need to continue playing until you've gotten rid of those.
4. Once you've gotten rid of those cards, and your turn comes around, you have to play one of your face-downs at random. The main rules still apply!
