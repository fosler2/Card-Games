# **[CENSORED] aka Cheesedog - A Game of Endless Fun**

#### _REQUIRES: 2 standard card decks, 3ish - 8ish players. 6 or 7 is a good number in my opinion. 10-30 minutes to play depending on the experience level of the players\._

#### _Test your wits with a hearty game of [CENSORED] AKA CHEESEDOG - a perfect balance of chance and sneaky strategy!!! It's similar to Uno, but WAY BETTER. There are no winners, but there is always one loser. Credit to Jack for originally teaching me the rules._

## _The Deal_

0. Shuffle two decks together (ideally with different backs, for separating back out when you're done playing)
1. Deal out four cards, FACE DOWN, to each player.
2. Deal out four cards, FACE UP, to each player.
3. Deal out the remaining cards, FACE DOWN, to each player.

## _Individual Setup_

1. Arrange your four FACE-DOWN and four FACE-UP cards however you prefer, but a good starting layout is:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**XXXX**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**YYYY**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**o**

&emsp;&emsp;where the X's are your FACE-DOWN cards and the Y's are your FACE-UPS, and your POV is at the 'o.'

2. Pick up your remaining pile, from step 3 of the deal. This is your starting hand.

## _Gameplay_

0. The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards. When a player completes this task, they will have avoided defeat. One of the players won't be so lucky - it's every player for themself in this game.
1. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by playing a card (or cards) in the middle of the table.
2. Cards may be played according to the following rules:

### Section 1 - General

> - RULE 1a: Played card(s) must be GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO the card at the top of the current pile.
> - RULE 1b: If none of your cards can be legally played, you have to pick up the pile.
> - RULE 1c: ACES are HIGH.
> - RULE 1d: If you have multiple of the same card, you may play any number of them at the same time, including all of them at once.
> - RULE 1e: Cards in your hand must be played first.

### Section 2 - Clearing the Pile

> - RULE 2a. If there are FOUR or more of the same card on the top of the pile, the pile is CLEARED (this means the pile goes to a DISCARD area and those cards exit the game).
> - RULE 2b. If you CLEAR the pile, you get to start the new pile by playing any card(s).
> - RULE 2c. If you CLEAR the pile, effects of SPECIAL cards are nullified.

### Section 3 - Special Cards

> _Note: Special cards still hold the value displayed on their face. For example, a 7 cannot be placed on a Queen or something, because of rule 1a._
>
> - 7: SKIP the next player. Multiple 7's skip multiple players.
> - 8: the next player has to play a card LESS THAN or EQUAL TO 8.
> - 9: REVERSE the direction of play. Multiple 9's reverse the direction multiple times. For example, with two 9's, play continues in the direction it was going prior to those two 9's being played. This is a "reverse reverse."
> - 10: CLEAR the pile to discard.
> - 2: The "best" card. Playable at any time regardless of what's on the pile. Tip: think of this card as a lifeline. Notice that when a 2 is played, the pile is effectively "reset" since 2 is the smallest card.

### Special Cards Quick Reference:

- 7 SKIP
- 8 LESS THAN
- 9 REVERSE
- 10 CLEAR
- 2 LIFELINE

### Section 4 - FACE-UPS and FACE-DOWNS (FLIPS)

> - RULE 4. All previous rules apply to these stages.
> - RULE 4a. Once you have played all of the cards in your hand (from step 3 of the deal), pick up your FACE-UP cards. These are now your hand, and you need to continue playing until you've gotten rid of all of those cards.
> - RULE 4b. Once you've run out of cards again, so only your FACE-DOWNS remain, you have to play your FACE-DOWN cards, one by one. These moves are your "FLIPS." You may only look at one FACE-DOWN card on each FLIP.
> - RULE 4c. If you have to pick up the pile on a FLIP, you do not have to show your card.
> - RULE 4d. Sometimes, your FLIP will happen on an empty pile, either from a CLEAR or the previous player picking up the pile. This is called a "FREE FLIP" since your FLIP is guaranteed to be playable on an empty pile.
> - RULE 4e. Once you've run out of cards for the third time (meaning you've completed all four of your FLIPS and there are no cards in your hand), congratulations! You've avoided defeat. The game continues until there is exactly one loser - everyone but this loser will have played all their cards.

### Section 5 - Game Finished

> - (optional) RULE 5a. Traditionally, the loser has to take a shot of the weirdest alcoholic drink available. For example, cheap cherry-flavored vodka.
> - RULE 5b. Gather the cards, move the deal to the left, shuffle, and play again!
