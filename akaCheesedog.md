# **aka Cheesedog - 3 Steps to the Deal, 4 Steps to the Gameplay! 7 Easy Steps to Endless Fun with Friends and Loved Ones.**

#### _Test your wits with a hearty game of [REDACTED] AKA CHEESEDOG !!! Best suited for 3ish to about 8 to 10ish players. 6 or 7 is a good number in my opinion. Credit to Jack for teaching me this game\._

<br/>

#### _It's a game of chance and sneaky strategy. There are no winners, but there is always one loser, so you play the game out until it's down to the last person._

<br/>

## _The Deal_

0. Shuffle two decks together (ideally with different backs, for separating back out when you're done playing)
1. Deal out four cards, FACE DOWN, to each player.
2. Deal out four cards, FACE UP, to each player.
3. Deal out the remaining cards, FACE DOWN, to each player.

## _Individual Setup_

1. Arrange your FACE-DOWN and FACE-UP cards however you prefer, but a good starting layout is:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**XXXX**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**YYYY**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**o**

&emsp;&emsp;where the X's are your FACE-DOWN cards and the Y's are your FACE-UPS, and your POV is at the 'o.'

2. Pick up your remaining pile. This is your starting hand.

## _Gameplay_

0. The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards. When that happens, you've escaped from the clutches of ol' [REDACTED] aka Cheesedog.
1. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by playing a card (or cards) in the middle of the table.
2. Cards may be played according to the following rules:

### Section 1 - General

> - RULE 1a: Played card(s) must be GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO the card at the top of the current pile.
> - RULE 1b: If none of your cards can be legally played, you have to pick up the pile.
> - RULE 1c: ACES are HIGH.
> - RULE 1d: If you have multiple of the same card, you may play any number of them at the same time, including all of them at once.

### Section 2 - Clearing the Pile

> - RULE 2a. If there are FOUR or more of the same card on the top of the pile, the pile is CLEARED (this means the pile goes to a DISCARD area and those cards exit the game).
> - RULE 2b. If you CLEAR the pile, you get to start the new pile by playing any card(s).
> - RULE 2c. If you CLEAR the pile, effects of SPECIAL cards are nullified.

### Section 3 - Special Cards

> _Note: Special cards still hold the value displayed on their face. For example, a 7 cannot be placed on an 8 or higher, because of rule 1a._
>
> - 7: SKIP the next player. Multiple 7's skip multiple players. It's customary to say "skip" for each 7 you put down.
> - 8: the NEXT player has to play a card LESS THAN or EQUAL TO 8. It's customary to say "less than" or "lower" or something to that effect when you play an 8.
> - 9: REVERSE the direction of play. Multiple 9's reverse the direction multiple times. It's customary to say "reverse" for each 9 you put down.
> - 10: CLEAR the pile to discard.
> - 2: Playable at any time regardless of what's on the pile. Think of this card as a lifeline.

### Section 4 - Post-Early Game

> - RULE 4a. Once you have played all of the cards in your hand, pick up your FACE-UP cards. These are now your hand, and you need to continue playing (essentially follow step 2 above) until you've gotten rid of all of those cards.
> - RULE 4b. Once you've gotten rid of those cards, and your turn comes around, you have to play one of your FACE-DOWN at random. The main rules after step 2 still apply!
